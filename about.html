        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>I aim to develop robust artificial intelligence architecture, theories, and advance the field while applying them to medical applications. My fascination with medical AI has been steadily growing, driven by two compelling factors. Firstly, in medical AI, all tasks like segmentation, classification, and reconstruction converge towards a single overarching goal: enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic procedures. This uniqueness gives us the opportunity to explore innovative approaches that can truly transform medical AI. Secondly, the realm of medical AI challenges us to create AI models in an inherently demanding environment. We face obstacles like data scarcity, the high cost of annotation labor, data sharing limitations due to privacy concerns, and the imperative to consider fairness and causality. However, these challenges present us with a high-stakes opportunity. That is, developing a robust AI technique in the high-stake setting of the medical domain will not only revolutionize medical AI but also contribute to the advancement of AI technology as a whole. While AI models that excel in simple tasks are prevalent today, we need AI models that can tackle specific and difficult tasks that even stymie most humans. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, this demand will only intensify.  Therefore, in the end, it will form a virtuous circle where progress in medical AI fuels overall AI capabilities and vice versa.</p>
